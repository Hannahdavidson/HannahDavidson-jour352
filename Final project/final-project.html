  <p class="chapterhead">Which Streaming Service is Superior?</p> <!--Delete if dont fill anything-->

  <p>Streaming services are slowly taking over the ways in which we watch television: this includes movies, TV shows, documentaries, even reality TV. Companies such as Disney, HBO, and even Amazon have even begun to release their own versions of streaming services, and for some, content from of their own production as well. However, the two that continue to reign over the others, thus creating a very hot topic for debate within the streaming services world: Netflix vs. Hulu. 
</p>


  
  <p class="intro">How They Started</p>

  <p>Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California. What started as a movie-delivery service soon became the first major streaming service and is now valued at over $194 billion. From 1997-2009 the company’s main focus was DVD sales and rental delivery, however in 2010 Netflix introduced streaming media along with the delivery service. By 2011, Netflix ditched the delivery model and kept only their streaming service.</p>

  <p>Hulu, on the other hand, was not founded until 2007, but followed its original plan of being a streaming service and is now valued at over $15 billion. It was established as a joint venture between News Corporation, NBC Universal, Providence Equity Partners, and in 2017, was bought by Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International.</p>

<p class="intro">How Much Do They Cost?</p>
<p>With an estimated number of over 100,000 movies and TV shows, Netflix offers three different plans for its viewers. The first, the Basic Plan, allows buyers to stream content on one device at a time in standard definition and allows buyers to download content onto one phone or tablet and is offered for $8.99/month. The second, the Standard Plan, allows buyers to stream content on two devices at the same time in high definition when applicable. It also allows individuals to download titles onto two phones or tablets and is offered for $12.99/month. The highest plan, the Premium Plan, allows viewers to stream content on four devices at the same time in high definition and ultra high definition (when applicable), and allows users to download content onto four phones or tablets, and is available for $15.99/month. They also offer a 30-day free trial for on-the-fence buyers. Netflix does not advertise their exact number of movies and TV shows offered because the number fluctuates as content expires and new TV shows and movies become available.</p>

<p>Similar to Netflix, Hulu also does not advertise how many movies and TV shows they offer, however it is estimated they have 1,650 TV shows and over 2,500 movies. However, with more partners than Netflix, they have multiple plans. Hulu offers four subscription plans, and from there offers 9 “add-ons”. The four subscription plans include: the Basic plan for $5.99/month and includes Hulu; the Premium plan for $11.99/month which includes Hulu with no advertisements; the Basic + Live TV plan for $54.99/month and offers Hulu and select Live TV channels; the last, the Premium + Live TV plan is offered at $60.99/month and includes Premium Hulu (no ads) and select Live TV channels. The add-ons include HBO ($14.99/month), Cinemax ($9.99/month), ShowTime ($10.99/month), Starz ($8.99/month), unlimited screens ($9.99/month), enhanced cloud DVR ($9.99/month), Español ($4.99/month), and Entertainment ($7.99/month). They also offer a plan for students which includes Spotify Premium with Hulu and Showtime costing $4.99/month.</p>

<p class="intro">What Do They Offer?</p>


<p>There is also a large difference in the content offered in Netflix vs. Hulu. Hulu is known primarily for its TV shows, and often releases TV episodes within 24-hours of the original airing. It often offers shows from networks such as NBC, ABC, Fox, ION Television, USA Network, Bracy Syfy, E!, and much more. Hulu is often more current than Netflix, offering popular TV and reality-type TV than Netflix. Although it is not as current as Hulu, Netflix offers more TV shows, films, and documentaries, and is even rumored to have more kid-friendly shows than Hulu. In 2013 however, Netflix launched its own production company and now produces new TV shows and movies at an alarming rate.</p>

  <p class="caption">"Black Mirror" and "Orange is the New Black" are a few of Netflix's most popular Netflix Originals, both of which are produced and directed by Netflix. "The Handmaids Tale" and "Looking for Alaska" are also two of Hulu's most famous Hulu Originals, and although produced by Hulu, are both based on novels written by Margaret Atwood and John Green, respecitvley.</p>


<p>Netflix is available in over 190 countries worldwide, and currently has over 183 million memberships. The content available may vary based on which country one is in. Hulu, on the other hand, is only available in the United States and certain U.S. military bases, depending on one’s subscription plan, and have over 30.4 million subscribers.</p>

  <blockquote>"It's great to be in a space where consumers are moving and trends are moving and you don't have to fight against the tide — you're rowing with the current."</blockquote>
    <p class="caption1"> -Hulu CEO Randy Freer, in an interview with CES on Hulu's rapid growth</p>

</script></br> 

  <!-- where image was. go back to html for reference-->


<p>Based on this information it is very apparent that these two are hard to compare. Simply put, they are different. They offer different content with different additional plans at different prices. Hopefully this clears up some questions, and allows you, the reader, to choose what gives you more bang for your buck! </p>
